For a value to be a unit within a set: needs to have a multiplicative inverse and additive inverse, so $0$ is not a unit in the rationals for example because $\frac{1}{0}$ doesn't make sense.

In this class, natural numbers is the positive integers and 0. If he specifies 'positive integers' it's without $0$ (obviously)

Set of integers under addition, neutral element is $0$, units are all integers

Real numbers under addition, units are all values

So if we have a set of numbers and all numbers in that set are a unit, then it is a group.

Monoid

Closure is nonsense, meaning any operation where the result is in the set.

Integers respect to division for example is not in the set, but he wouldn't even call it an operation

Operations are closed by definition

Ring has three axioms:

Group under addition
Monoid under multiplication
Distributivity for both operations (this counts as two rules because the value of $a(bc)$ and $(bc)a$ are different)

$ab+ac=a(b+c)$ that's what you need to check

If a ring has multiplicative wise, all units except for the identity/neutral, then it is a field

Addition is always commutative, so a ring is only commutative when multiplication is also commutative
