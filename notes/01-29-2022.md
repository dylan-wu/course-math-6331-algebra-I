Definition of a ring:

A set that has two operations addition and multiplication

$\mathbb{Q}[\zeta]$ is all numbers of form:

$a+b\zeta\space a,b\in\mathbb{Q}$

$(1+2\zeta)+(3+4\zeta)=4+5\zeta$ which is in $\mathbb{Q}[\zeta]$

Or:

$(a+b\zeta)+(c+d\zeta)=(a+c)+(b+d)\zeta$ is the definition of a number in $\mathbb{Q}[\zeta]$ because $a+c$ and $b+d$ are both rational.

$(a+b\zeta)(c+d\zeta)=ac+ad\zeta+bc\zeta+bd\zeta^2$

$\zeta^3=1$

$\zeta^3-1=0$

$\zeta^3-1=(\zeta-1)(\zeta^2+\zeta+1)$

$0=(\zeta-1)(\zeta^2+\zeta+1)$ then either $(\zeta-1)$ or $(\zeta^2+\zeta+1)$. Must be $(\zeta^2+\zeta+1)$ otherwise $\zeta=1$

$\zeta^2=-\zeta-1$

Then:

For this equation $(a+b\zeta)(c+d\zeta)=ac+ad\zeta+bc\zeta+bd\zeta^2$

We have $(ac-bd)+(ad+bc-bd)\zeta$

$a+bi=\frac{a}{a^2+b^2}+\frac{-b}{a^2+b^2}i$

Now we can say that $\mathbb{Q}[\zeta]$ is a ring

$\nu:\mathbb{C}^\times$ means that you take out the $0$ so that you only have a multiplicative group (no addition, because no additive neutral element)

$\nu:\mathbb{Q}[i]^\times\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}^\times$

Let's take:

$a+bi,a,b\in\mathbb{Q}\mapsto a^2+b^2$

$3+4i\mapsto25$

$1+i\mapsto2$

$\phi:G\rightarrow G'$ is a [[homomorphism]] if $\phi(ab)=\phi(a)\phi(b)$ for $a,b\in G$ (G in this case means a group)

Now we see if $\nu$ is a [[homomorphism]]

$\nu((a+bi)(c+di))$

$\nu((ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i)$

$(ac-bd)^2+(ad+bc)^2$

$=a^2c^2+a^2d^2+b^2c^2+b^2d^2$

And $(a^2+b^2)(c^2+d^2)=a^2c^2+a^2d^2+b^2c^2+b^2d^2$

Now let's take an additive [[group]] $A$

If we have a $\phi:A\mapsto A'$

If $\phi$ is a homomorphism: $\phi(a+b)=\phi(a)+\phi(b)$.

$\mathbb{R}$ is an [[additive group]], take it and have:

$\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^\times$

Let's call this function $e$

If we take $a$ then the image is $2^a$

$e(a+b)=e(a)e(b)$ (because the codomain is multiplicative and the domain is additive)

$2^{a+b}=2^a2^b$

What would a [[homomorphism]] of a [[ring]] be?

Maybe when $\phi(a+b)=\phi(a)+\phi(b)$

and when $\phi(ab)=\phi(a)\phi(b)$

You also need the neutral elements to go to each other

Let's take a [[ring]] [[homomorphism]]: $\kappa:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$

$a+bi\rightarrow a-bi$

$\kappa((a+bi)+(c+di))=\kappa(a+bi)+\kappa(c+di)$

$\kappa((a+bi)+(c+di))=(a+c)-(b+d)i$

$\kappa(a+bi)+\kappa(c+di)=a-bi+c-di$

$\kappa((a+bi)(c+di))=\kappa(a+bi)\kappa(c+di)$

$\kappa((a+bi)(c+di))=(ac-bd)-(ad+bc)i$

$(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i$

$\kappa(a+bi)\kappa(c+di)=(a-bi)(c-di)$

$ac-adi-bci-bd$

$=(ac-bd)-(-ad-bc)i$

$=(ac-bd)-(ad+bc)i$

[[Determinant]] is a [[homomorphism]]

$\det(AB)=\det(A)\det(B)$

$GL_{2\times2}(\mathbb{Q})$

$Mat_{2\times2}(\mathbb{Q})$

Then $\det$ is a function that goes from $GL_2(\mathbb{Q})\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}^\times$

$A\mapsto\det(A)$

group homo

[[Injective]] function is that if you have two elements and they are different then they cannot have the same image

$a+bi\rightarrow a-bi$ is injective ($\kappa$)

[[Surjective]] is that all outputs have an input

[[Bijective]] means injective and surjective

Bijective homomorphism is an isomorphism

If domain and codomains are the same in an [[isomorphism]], then it is an [[automorphism]]. Meaning $\kappa$ is an automorphism

## Switch topics

An order is a binary relation that is reflexive, anti-symmetric, transitive

[[Reflexive]]: $a\space R\space a$

[[Symmetric]]: $a\space R\space b$ then $b\space R\space a$

[[Anti-symmetric]]: $a\space R\space b$ and $b\space R\space a$ then $a=b$

[[Transitive]]: $a\space R\space b$ and $b\space R\space c$ then $a\space R\space c$

Equivalence relation is reflexive, symmetric, transitive

Subset is an order (test it for yourself)

Maximal element means that it is not a subset of any other sets (other than itself). There can be multiple

[[Ideal]] of a ring is a subgroup of the additive group. Meaning we need $0$. The set of all even numbers is an ideal. The set of multiples of any number is an ideal (because when you add any of them together you get a multiple of that number)

Take the set of all ideals in the integers. Order them via inclusion.

$4\mathbb{Z}$ contained in $2\mathbb{Z}$ (for example)

This is also an order

There are infinitely many maximal elements because all prime numbers are unique in our sets.

Let $Y$ and $Z$ be ordered sets. A map $\phi$ from $Y$ to $Z$ is called order preserving if $v^\phi\le w^\phi$ for any two elements $v$ and $w$ in $Y$ with $v\le w$

IMPORTANT: $v^\phi$ is the same as $\phi(v)$

## [[Galois Pairs]]

Two sets, $Y$ and $Z$, two functions from $Y$ to $Z$ and one from $Z$ to $Y$.

Let's say $\gamma$ is $Y$ to $Z$

$\phi$ is $Z$ to $Y$

They both must be order reversing.

Want we want is if we have an element which we do $\gamma$ then $\phi$ is returning to the element we started with

$y\le\phi(\gamma(y))$

$y\le y^{\gamma\phi}$

$z\le z^{\phi\gamma}$

The two functions $(\gamma,\phi)$ is a [[Galois Pair]].

Set $X:=\{1,2,3\}$

$\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\},\{\}$

IMPORTANT: Cool notation ![[Pasted image 20220129110618.png | 500]] up means contained

$khk:1\rightarrow3$

$2\rightarrow2$

$hh$ is an identity

If you have a function and you compose it with the identity you get the original function. Compose here just means apply

$d=hkh$
